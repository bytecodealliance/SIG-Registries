        - Sort of like if microservices and low-level languages had a love-child
        - It's sort of as if sig-store and OCI/npm registries had a love child.
        - Comparisons help people to understand
    - Tie each idea back to a practical topic
        - every other slide include something funny or practical
        - include stories or interesting/real tidbits
    - Certificate transparency is a key topic
    - How is this different/better than OCI Merkle trees?
        - Be sure to distill this.
    - Make public and open source (how do others contribute?) - SIG-Registries
    - Lego Base plates - should I mention worlds?
