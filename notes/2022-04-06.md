### Agenda

- volunteers for note taking
    - Michelle and anyone else who wants to help
- welcoming new SIG members and meeting attendees
    - no new members
- the SIG process, governance, taking decisions, code of conduct
    - Postpone for update from Till or Ralph
    - https://github.com/bytecodealliance/governance/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
    - https://github.com/bytecodealliance/governance/blob/main/operational-principles.md
- formalizing scheduling demos
    - announce meeting before or in the HackMD before the meeting
    - 10-15 minutes for demo + discussion
- updates on the `wit-bindgen` implementation for components -  https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen/pull/183
    - MERGED! woo!
    - new tool called wit-components - for producing components
        - currently updating wastime to execute components
        - wit-component is going to be the basis of cargo-component
    - In the future, should be able to link components
        - linking will require a new tool (probably not going to use wasm-link)
- what object should I expect when doing a GET from the component registry?
    - In the past, we've talked about implementation details. It would be good to start exploring
    - Discuss types of objects tools interact with when communicating with the registry
    - Am I get an opaque blob or am I getting something that is looks semantically like a WASM component?
    - (Luke) Some cases require just binary with specific Mime type. Also encountering cases where you want to bundle static assets, we might want to decouple code and data.
        - Single file representation vs. tree form.
        - All the bits vs description as if component was a directory with nested things.
        - HTTP API with Accept header that gives you what you require
    - (Nathaniel) Alternating Accept header is the way we envisioned working with Drawbridge API. In alignment with Luke.
    - (Lann) What does the resource look like
    - (Nathaniel) Drawbridge is a collection of APIs. Can list tags which can be wrapped in an intelligent queries.
    - (Taylor) Want to be able to upload related things as part of one component. Worth exploring quic route.
    - (Michelle) pro
    - (Lann) About listing components and discovering components. Not so much fetching an artifact you want but on component discovery, metatadata, authorization. Those are the harder things to agree on upfront.
    - (Taylor) Storage layer decoupled from registry API
    - (Nathaniel) Drawbridge API not just a storage API. It's the API exposed to clients.
    - (Lann) Drawbridge not backend but paraellel.
    - (Radu) We keep not talking about the Registry API. We keep going back to storage.
    - (Luke) Should we shift our discussion to talk about the initial discovery
    - (Brian) Merit in going back and forth to
    - (Radu) discussion of storage layer apis is valuable but we're not talking about the initial discussion of how component tooling interacts with the registry API.
    - Resolution: GET request should return a component or a package that contains a component and metadata
    - (Radu) What does the package look like?
    - Discussion on where metadata lives
        - Inherent (data that should be part of the crypotgraphic inherent) vs exherent data
    - (Radu) What types of metadata do we want associated with a package?
        - Version, authors, etc.
    - (Lann) On request to get the latest stable verison of a particular named package? How do we get the latest version of a package?
        - (Nathaniel) Semver queries but also may want to say what is the latest version that is compatible with X. Need more data to do intelligent queries.
        - In drawbridge, you can GET a package and get back a list of versions or you can do a  on the same with the semver query and get back what package satisfies the query.

For next week:
- What metadata fields we want based on the metadata we discussed?
- Lets use OpenAPI tools to start modeling the API
